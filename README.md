py-dyn-tracker
==============

A simple python client-server system to keep track of multiple computers with dynamic IP addresses. 
Simply run server.py on a computer with a static IP address or domain name and add that to client.conf. 
You can then run client.py on all of your computers and they will phone home, reporting their IP addresses
and hostnames.
